### **Installing NVM**

  All documentation (including for Windows can be found at [official repository of NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
  Open your terminal and type `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash`

### **Installing Node.js**

  On same terminal type `nvm install v12.16.3` and next `nvm use v12.16.3`
  This commands basicly say to you computer to download Node.js at version 12.16.3 (that is the current LTS version, but you can see if changes on [NodeJS official site](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and use it.

### **Installing Yarn**

  Yarn is a package manager that will be used for download all dependencies and executing our project (yes, our project. You're being part of this now).
  To this, you have two options:

  1 - Go to the [official Yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/) and see by yourself how to install;

  2 - Run this command: `npm install -g yarn`

  **Now we've all we need to start executing our project. This is so exciting!**

## üöÄ **Running the Project**

### Make a Clone

  You can just download by the green button on right top [this page](https://github.com/danilo-vieira/github-explorer).

  Or with Git Bash:

  ```bash
  # make a clone of this repository
  git clone https://github.com/danilo-vieira/github-explorer.git

  # go to the downloaded folder
  cd github-explorer
  ```

### **Opening the Project**

  Now, open this directory with your IDE ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended cause it has a integrated terminal)

### **With the terminal run `yarn`**

  Yes, just it. This will install all needed dependencies. Take a break and drink a coffee while waiting ‚òïüòã.

### **Initializing the Project**

  To this you can run `yarn start`

Your default browser will be opened on "http://localhost:3000" and here is our main page.

After this, you're free to make changes, add features, fix some bug. Just make a pull request if you want to share your idea with me and make this project better!
